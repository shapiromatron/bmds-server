# Welcome to BMDS Desktop.

This application is the desktop launcher for the BMDS Desktop application. From this page, you can start the application, as well as review the logs for the application. We hope that you'll have no need to review the logs, but if there's an issue, it makes it possible to send diagnostics to the application developers, should you wish.

BMDS Desktop runs in your browser, but the data and execution all all performed locally, and no data is sent to any external server. To check, you could disable wifi and confirm that the software should perform without error.

An online application exists: [https://bmdsonline.epa.gov](https://bmdsonline.epa.gov).
