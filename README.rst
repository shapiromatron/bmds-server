        :alt: Documentation Status

Run a webserver that will batch process dose-response data using the US EPA's
benchmark dose modeling software (BMDS_).  Under the hood, this web application
uses the `BMDS Python interface`_.

.. _`BMDS Python interface`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bmds

To use the webserver, specify a new BMDS Job using a input file formatted
like this.

.. code:: javascript

    {
        "dataset_type": "D",
        "bmds_version": "BMDS2601",
        "datasets": [
            {
                "doses": [0, 1.96, 5.69, 29.75],
                "ns": [75, 49, 50, 49],
                "incidences": [5, 1, 3, 14]
            },
            {
                "doses": [0, 1.96, 5.69, 29.75],
                "ns": [75, 49, 50, 49],
                "incidences": [0, 0, 11, 27]
            }
        ]
    }

You'll receive a Job ID back, and you can check the website to see when the job
is complete. Then, results can be downloaded. Results include:

- The dfile created for each model
- The outfile created for each model
- The parsed output file for each model
- A recommended best-fitting model, using guidance from `Wignall et al. 2014`_ (optional)

To run your own BMDS webserver, you'll need a Windows server. Deployment steps
have been documented using a Windows Server 2012 and IIS 8.5; it may be possible
to run in other environments.
